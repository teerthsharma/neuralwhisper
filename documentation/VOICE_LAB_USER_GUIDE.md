# Voice Lab - User Guide

## Introduction
The Voice Lab is your personal studio for creating custom AI voice clones. By uploading a short audio sample, you can generate a "Neural Identity" that the ASMR Reader will use to read your texts.

## How to Create a Voice

### Step 1: Initialize Identity
1.  Navigate to the **Voice Lab** by clicking the "🧬 Voice Lab" button in the top header.
2.  **Drag & Drop** an audio file (MP3/WAV) into the holographic containment field.
    *   *Tip: For best results, use a clear, noise-free recording of a single voice talking naturally for 5-10 seconds.*

### Step 2: Neural Analysis
The system will process the audio. You will see a "Neural Matrix" animation as the AI extracts detailed characteristics:
- **Pitch**: The highness or lowness of the voice.
- **Warmth**: How "rich" or "full" the voice sounds.
- **Breathiness**: The amount of air in the voice (crucial for ASMR).
- **Clarity**: How distinct the pronunciation is.

### Step 3: Configuration & Deployment
Once analysis is complete, you will be presented with a **Bio-Metric Analysis** card and an **Identity Designation** card.
1.  **Review Data**: Check the analyzed stats like 'Fundamental Frequency' to see what the AI detected.
2.  **Name Identity**: Enter a cool codename for your voice (e.g., "Night Shade" or "Professor X").
3.  **Deploy**: Click **DEPLOY IDENTITY**.
    *   The voice is now saved to your browser's local memory.
    *   You will be returned to the main deck.

## Using Your Custom Voice
1.  Open the **Advanced Settings** panel (bottom right of the main screen).
2.  Look for the **Custom Voice Embeddings** section.
3.  Click your new voice to activate it. The AI will now synthesize speech using the characteristics of your clone!

## Exporting & Sharing
You can share your voice clones with others!
1.  In the Voice Lab (Step 3), click **EXPORT JSON**.
2.  Send the downloaded `.json` file to a friend.
3.  They can drag & drop that file into their Voice Lab to instantly import your settings.
